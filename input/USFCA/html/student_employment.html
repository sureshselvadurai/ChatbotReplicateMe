            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-bp-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden custom-block field__item"><p>Two types of student employment are available at USF: Federal Work-Study (FWS) and non-work-study employment. The first type&nbsp;of employment is a&nbsp;form&nbsp;of financial aid. That is, if you applied for financial aid,&nbsp;have high financial need, and have indicated your interest in the Federal Work-Study program, then you may receive a FWS&nbsp;award on your offer of financial aid from USF. The second type of employment is employment that does not require you to have a need-based work award.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Federal Work-Study (FWS) program is funded in part by the U.S. Department of Education and grants a student priority consideration for employment. Non-work-study student employment is funded by the hiring department. There is no differential pay rate, hours, or benefits. There is a difference, however, in the priority granted to students who are seeking employment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When hiring managers have two or more equally qualified candidates for a position, priority consideration for the position is granted in the following way: (1) to the FWS student, and (2)&nbsp;to the student without a need-based work award.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although financial aid applicants must report student employment earnings on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), earnings from a FWS position may be reported as need-based earnings so as not to count against the calculation of need for financial aid.&nbsp;</p>

Some jobs, like Teaching Assistant or Research Assistant, are inherently offered per semester, while other jobs, such as University Ambassador or Athletics Concession Staff, need to be staffed all year. It is recommended that students discuss assignment lengths when interviewing for each position so they're able to choose the job that works best for their needs.</p>

<p>However, student employment is terminated upon graduation (or when a student withdrawals from the institution). Should a department want to maintain the employee beyond the student employee eligibility status, the employee would need to be hired as a temp through <a href="/human-resources/hiring/hiring-temporary-staff" target="_blank">HR Options</a>.</p>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-bp-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden custom-block field__item"><p>A Federal Work-Study (FWS) award is a Federal Student Aid program that supports student employment for college students. Direct support is provided in the form of a financial subsidy to the hiring department. Currently, the FWS program at USF subsidizes 75% of the wages a work-study student earns in an on-campus FWS position&nbsp;and, most often, 100% of the wages a work-study student earns in an&nbsp;off-campus FWS position. This subsidy reduces the amount paid by the hiring department or employer. The total amount you may earn with a work-study award is determined by the USF Financial Aid Office. Your financial aid award letter will inform you if you have received a FWS award.</p>

<p>Under the FWS program, student gross earnings are limited to the amount awarded on the financial aid award letter. If the award is earned in-full before the end of the academic year, the supervisor must agree to convert the job into a non-Work-Study position or the work must be terminated. If you have a FWS award, we recommend you estimate your hours with your supervisor at the beginning of the year to anticipate when the full award will be earned and to discuss what to expect when the award is exhausted. If your hiring department does not have funds to convert your job to a non-Work-Study position, you may request an increase in your award amount by sending a written appeal to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:stuemp@usfca.edu" target="_blank">stuemp@usfca.edu</a>. Eligibility for an award increase depends on your remaining financial need as well as available funding; therefore, not all requests may be granted.</p>

<p>Students who have been hired into their first job at USF will complete all employment requirements in their&nbsp;<em>temporary</em>&nbsp;USFWorks account.

<p>Once rehired, returning student workers will complete their onboarding tasks by accessing USFWorks for Student Employee from the myApps portal. When all 10 tasks are submitted and <em><strong>on or before your first day of work</strong></em>, contact the Office of Student Employment to confirm that a valid Form I-9 is on file for your employment.</p>

<p>You may also wish to complete the optional profile with Sprintax TDS (Tax Determination System). Completion of this profile will determine whether a tax treaty is available between your native country and the U.S. that may lessen the amount of taxes withheld from&nbsp;your paycheck. Although a tax treaty is not guaranteed, completing the Sprintax TDS profile can also assist in other ways.

The San Francisco Paid Sick Leave Ordinance allows student employees working within San Francisco County to accrue 1 hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked, up to 72 hours. Paid sick leave begins to accrue upon your first day of work. Eligible sick leave should be reported on your timesheet and approved by your supervisor. Assuming you have accrued enough sick-leave to do so, you may request sick pay for up to the full scheduled work shift that was missed but no further.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>
If you need to take more than 3 days of paid leave, assuming you have accrued enough time to do so, your supervisor may require a doctor's note to verify the necessity of your absence.<br><br><strong>Additional notes regarding paid sick leave</strong>:</p>

<p>Student employees&nbsp;are not paid out for unused sick-leave at the end of a job assignment or upon graduating or leaving the University.</p>

<p>Within the County of San Francisco: 1) Employers must provide paid sick leave for part-time employees, including all student employees; 2) Employees may use paid leave for their own medical needs and to care for family members; and 3) Employees with no spouse or partner may use the leave to care for a "designated person."</p>

<ul><li>Diagnosis, care, or treatment of an existing health condition of an employee or an employeeâ€™s family member (self, child, parent, in loco parentis, spouse, registered domestic partner, or designated person, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, and legal guardians and wards)</li>
	<li>Preventive medical care for an employee or an employeeâ€™s family member</li>
	<li>Leave for an employee who is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking</li>
</ul><p>The University prefers that all employees schedule medical appointments outside normal working hours. However, if it is impossible to do so, sick leave may be used for medical appointments and advance notice should be given to the employeeâ€™s supervisor.</p>

<p>Only accrued time can be used and must be approved by the employeeâ€™s supervisor. If the need to use sick leave is foreseeable, employees must provide reasonable advance notice of absence to their supervisor. For unpredictable situations, such as emergencies, accidents, or sudden illnesses, employees must provide notice as soon as practicable. Specifically:</p>

<ul><li>All student staff should inform their supervisor if they cannot work due to illness and record the sick hours in USFWorks.</li>
	<li>Student staff can visit the <a href="/sites/default/files/users/lpixler/SE_ Timesheet, Benefits Training Document (1).pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Timesheets &amp; Benefits</a> guide (pgs.&nbsp;17 - 19)&nbsp;for detailed instructions on reporting sick leave.</li>
</ul><p>Sick leave of less than three days normally requires no verification; however, supervisors may&nbsp;request appropriate documentation from a student&nbsp;employee, depending on the circumstances or absenteeism history.</p>

<p>For those who have been employed with the university for more than 90 days and who regularly work at least 8 hours per week, USF will make a quarterly healthcare expenditure on behalf of the employee. As of January 1, 2022, <strong>the healthcare expenditure rate is $3.30 per payable hour</strong>, which has increased from $3.18 per hour in 2021. If USF makes a contribution on your behalf, you will receive a SF City Option welcome letter and instructions to enroll in an SF City Option health care program.</p>

<p>Once you are enrolled, you may start spending funds for eligible health care expenses. If you already have employer-provided health coverage as either an employee of another company or as a dependent of another person, you may complete and submit a <a href="/sites/default/files/health-care-security-ordinance-hcso-employee-voluntary-waiver-form.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Voluntary Waiver Form</a> and receive a $125&nbsp;credit (taxable income)&nbsp;to your next paycheck.</p>
