Parents,What is FERPA?,"FERPA, also known as the Buckley Amendment, is the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. It is federal legislation designed to protect the privacy of students by limiting third party access to student education records. When students enter USF, regardless of their age, all rights to inspect and review educational records transfer from parents to students."
Parents,May I have access to my student's grades?,"Families may not have access to their student’s grades without the written permission of their student. FERPA provides students with the significant rights of access to their educational records—including grades—as well as protects the privacy of student records. Only material classified as Directory Information, as defined in the general catalog, can be released without student consent. The permission to disclosed non-directory information to a third party, including parents, must be filed with the Registrar’s office and any other office that holds records regarding the student. Students may gain access to any written academic records directly concerning them. There are some records, however, such as financial records of parents, to which a student has no right of access. Students can visit student consent instructions on how to grant USF permission to release information to authorized individuals."
Parents,How will I know if my student is subject to University disciplinary action?,Student disciplinary records are protected under FERPA. The best practice is for your student to inform you of any disciplinary charges directly. Students can also authorize the release of any or all the information in their disciplinary files.
Parents,Does my student need a car?,"Students do not need cars. San Francisco has a world class transportation system which includes: MUNI passes (local buses, street cars) are provided to all undergrad students; BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) that includes a rail system that connects the major San Francisco metropolitan area as well as two major airports; Cal Train that links San Francisco with San Francisco Peninsula cities and communities; bike racks are located throughout campus; Zimride is an online ridesharing community where students, faculty, and staff can find one another to carpool together; Zipcar is a car sharing program that allows Zipcar members to rent a car by the hour or by the day at discounted rates, which includes gas, mileage, and insurance. Zipcars are located at two convenient locations on campus."
Parents,Do we apply for financial aid each year to be offered need-based financial aid?,"Yes, the FAFSA application is a yearly form that becomes available at www.fafsa.gov beginning January 1 each year. It is very important for new students to file the appropriate year FAFSA by February 1 and continuing USF students by March 2 each year to be considered timely and to have their eligibility considered for limited USF need-based grant funding for the following academic year. FAFSA applications filed after the priority filing deadlines are considered late and may affect eligibility for USF need-based grants and scholarships."
Parents,What is the difference between grants or scholarships and loans?,"The University’s tuition grants and scholarships are gifts that do not need to be repaid. Student loans must be repaid so each borrower should review the terms and conditions of each loan offered before accepting it. In most cases, repayment is deferred until the student is no longer enrolled at least half-time."
Parents,Our student has been selected for verification. Do we have to complete and return a verification worksheet?,"Yes, you must complete the worksheet (may be printed from our website) and return it with the required tax documents. The financial aid award is not final and no aid will be credited towards charges or paid to the Student Account until verification is complete."
Parents,When is financial aid going to be paid to the USF student account?,"At the beginning of each semester and once the student has enrolled properly and completed all the requirements for disbursement, the financial aid will be paid to the USF student account. Students can regularly view their Unsatisfied Requirements in the Financial Aid section of their USFConnect account."
Parents,We are expecting to receive a refund from financial aid. When and how will these funds be made available?,"Credit balances created by federal student aid are refunded by check unless a student’s Direct Deposit information is provided to Student Enrollment Services/Student Accounts. For Federal Direct parent PLUS Loans, credit balances are refunded by check to the parent borrower unless the borrower authorizes a refund to be made to the student. In general, a refund will be available within 14 days of disbursement of financial aid into the student account."

In addition, each donation, regardless of amount, demonstrates to other potential donors that USF is considered to be a worthy investment by those who know it best — alumni, parents, and friends."
Parents,Can I designate my gift to a specific program at USF?,"Gifts to the Parents Fund provide support for USF ‘s strategic priorities and most pressing needs.

student-employment,I have a financial aid work award (FWS).

If you are having difficulty finding a job on-campus, you are encouraged to utilize the counseling services offered by the USF Career Services Center or The Writing Center to develop a resume, learn to write a cover letter, and practice interviewing skills. Most positions are posted and filled within the first few weeks of classes each fall, but job openings do occur throughout the year, so we encourage you to monitor the job posting board on a regular basis. Be sure to follow up directly with the hiring departments for more information about a job posting and its availability."

If at any time your supervisor decides that your performance is not satisfactory, you may be released from employment."

If changes in class schedule, academic pressures, or volume of work in the department make a work commitment impossible, and you feel that it is necessary to terminate your employment, please speak to your supervisor. If you decide to terminate your employment, provide a minimum two-week notice along with the reason for the termination of your assignment."

Generally, positions which require more technical and specialized skills, or which require specific work experience, or greater levels of responsibility are compensated at higher rates of pay. As of July 1, 2021, San Francisco's minimum wage increased to $16.32/hour."
